The Resume.css file contains styles that define the appearance and styles of the app, such as the background color, text alignment to center, and font size.
The Resume.js file imports the Resume.css file and defines the Resume component. 
The App.js file imports both the Resume.css and Resume.js files. It defines the App component, which provides it as the main component for the web app.
Inside the App component, the Resume component is rendered within a div element with the className App.
When the web app is executed, the App component is rendered, which in turn renders the Resume component.
Output:
The output of the web app is a user interface (UI) that displays the name "Jayasudha" as a level 1 heading as mentioned h1 and the address/contact information as a paragraph.
The UI is styled according to the styles defined in the Resume.css file, including the text alignment, background color, and font size.
