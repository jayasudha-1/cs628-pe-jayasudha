Styling (styles.css): This part defines the CSS styling for various elements in the application, including headers, links, and buttons.

Component Definitions (App.js, AddCity.js, CityList.js, Listed.js, CityDetails.js): These components define the structure, behavior, and logic of the application.

Process:

App Component (App.js): The main component of the application. It sets up routing using the react-router-dom library and defines the different routes using the <Routes> and <Route> components.

CityList Component (CityList.js): Displays the main page of the application. It lists all the cities and provides links to view their details and add new cities. When a city link is clicked, the handleCityClick function is called to set the selectedCity state to the clicked city.

AddCity Component (AddCity.js): Provides a form to add a new city. When the form is submitted, it adds the new city data to the list and navigates to the cities list page.

Listed Component (Listed.js): Similar to the CityList component, it lists all the cities. However, it displays the selected city's details at the bottom of the list when a city link is clicked.

CityDetails Component (CityDetails.js): Displays the details of a selected city, including its name, country, and population. It receives the selected city data as a prop.

Output:

City List Application (CityList Component): When users access the root URL "/", they are redirected to the "/cities" route, which displays a header and a link to the "Cities List" page. This page lists all the cities with links to their details. Users can click on a city's name to view its details. There's also a "Add City" link to navigate to the page for adding a new city.

Add City Form (AddCity Component): When users click on the "Add City" link on the "Cities List" page, they are taken to a form where they can input a new city's name, country, and population. When the form is submitted, the new city is added to the list and users are redirected back to the "Cities List" page.

City Details (CityDetails Component): When users click on a city's name link, the details of the selected city are displayed, including its name, country, and population.

Listed Component: Similar to the CityList component, this page also lists all the cities. However, when users click on a city's name, the selected city's details are displayed at the bottom of the list.

Users can view a list of cities, add new cities, and view details of each city. The styling is defined using CSS classes for various elements.
